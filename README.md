# blackjack
 A simple blackjack game made from vanilla HTML, CSS and Javascript.

Before starting this project, I've only had around 1 month of HTML and CSS knowledge and 2 weeks of Javascript experience. This project was mainly to build up my core fundamentals of coding. I'm happy that I was able to complete it within a day, even though I still had to look up how `addEventlisteners()` worked and other basic syntaxes that manipulated the DOM. I haven't properly learned the basics of DOM yet, but I look forward to understanding how it works in the future as it is definetly one of the fields that interest me the most. 

I plan on revisitng this project sometime in the future, to maybe refactor the code or add some win/lose point system into the game. I also want to add more blackjack features such as betting, splitting and folding against the computer. I also want to learn how to manipulate images with javascript making the game visually more appearing with animations of cards and chips on the table.
